# To Do List

## Description
This is a simple project to learn and practice programming in Python and perhaps other languages. It functions as a database to add tasks to a to do list, set target dates, and update if they are finished.

## Quick Start
Make sure Python 3 is installed on the computer running this program. Then in your command line navigate to the root directory and enter "python3 main.py" into the command line.

## Usage
As of right now, there is no input functionality and is simply testing functions.
